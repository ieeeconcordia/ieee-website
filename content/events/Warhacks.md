## About the Event

Warhacks is a one-day event designed to introduce CEGEP students to the world of hardware hackathon. Come spend the day with us, and you will get to build your robot from scratch.

## What You Need

There is no previous knowledge needed, Warhacks offers different workshop tutorials that will teach you skills for robotics building. Things like programming, motor control, sensor reading, and much more will be covered during these tutorials.

## The Competition

Working in teams of three or four, you will put your creativity to work and build a robot that will accomplish some given challenges. These challenges will be unveiled at the beginning of the competition.

## Why Should I Attend

Choosing where to continue your education after graduating is tough. What should I study, what university/ college should I go to? It can be hard to work out what you should study and where. We do not have a solution for that, but we offer an opportunity to explore one of your interests.
