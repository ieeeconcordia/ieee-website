It will cover breadboards and circuit assembly, essential electronic components such as resistors and diodes, as well as measurement tools like multimeters and oscilloscopes. Students will also get hands-on experience with different power supplies, including AC voltage and DC sources.

Details: September 5th, 2:30 PM - 5:30 PM at Concordia University's 4th Space (1400 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal  QC, H3G 1M8) with FREE tickets!
