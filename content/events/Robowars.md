## About The Event

Robowars is a competitive robotic event that invites passionate and enthusiastic participants from all over Montreal and beyond to showcase their engineering skills. The goal is simple yet challenging: Build an autonomous robot that can outsmart rival robots by pushing them out of the arena while staying within the designated area. Prior to the competition day, you will have to design and program a sumo robot so that it can operate without any external governance during battles; This robot will have to compete with other robots within a limited area. In order to win, your robot should kick out its opponents while staying in the arena.

## Why Should I Attend

This competition will allow you to demonstrate your engineering expertise and connect with fellow robotic enthusiasts while enjoying an amazing competitive ambiance. Furthermore, many cash prizes are waiting for you, so don't miss this opportunity, and may the best robot win!

## Announcements

We will also be hosting some training sessions prior to the competition so don't miss them.
