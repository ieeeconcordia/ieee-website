Robowars is the first official robot-sumo tournament in North America recognized by the FSI - AJRST (All Japan Robot-Sumo Tournament)! The competition pits sumo-bots against one another to see who can push their competitor out of the ring first ðŸ¤–

Participants are tasked with building a sumo robot capable of being active-reactive in the ring. Therefore, this is the perfect opportunity for students to expand and showcase their engineering skills! Additionally, the organizing team is working to attract potential recruiters to the event so students can showcase their talents.
