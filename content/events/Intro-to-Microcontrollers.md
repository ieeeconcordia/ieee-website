  Micro controllers tutorials are essential for students to gain some hands on
  experience and learn the basics for countless projects. We plan on hosting an
  intro to microcontrollers in embedded C, and motor control, all taught by an
  expert. We'll follow with some sensor data reading & finish with displaying
  said data.

## About The Event

Welcome to the "Intro to Microcontrollers" workshop âš’ðŸ¤–, where you'll embark on an exciting journey into the world of microcontrollers! This event is specially designed for students like you who are curious about these tiny but powerful devices and want to understand how they work and what you can do with them.

## Why Should I Attend

In this beginner-friendly session, you'll learn how to:

* Take away your own ESP32 kit with lots of components like ESP32, breadboad, motor controller, and many sensors like IR, Temperature and Humidity, PRI sensors.
* Understanding of basic functionality of the ESP32 microcontroller
* Code using arduino IDE to program the microcontroller
* Control lights with your phone
* Use motion control with the help of a infrared sensor

## What You Need

A laptop (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to write and upload code to microcontrollers, curiosity, and an open mind ready to explore the world of microcontrollers. No prior experience is necessary; this workshop is designed for beginners. âš¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š
