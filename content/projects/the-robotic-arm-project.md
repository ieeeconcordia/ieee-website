## About

The goal of this project is to use state of the art technology to develop and
  fully design a 3d-Printed 7-axis robotic arm. The innovations began in the
  design of the robotic arm. A complex cyclical gearbox will be developed,
  tested and used as each of the joints of the 7-Axis arm. Generative design
  will be implemented to connect the cycloidal joints to one another. When the
  arm is built, it will be controlled by computer vision and AI powered
  automation features. Specific machine learning algorithms will be built for
  the robot arm to control specific actions. As a whole the arm will be
  extremely technologically advanced, due to innovations at every step of its
  development.
