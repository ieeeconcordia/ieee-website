## About

This project is all about Automation and Intelligent IoT devices. The goal of this project is to engage students who are new to projects and teamwork. We aim to have them contribute to individual projects, creating cool gadgets, sensors, and devices. At the same time, we'll integrate these separate devices into one big, interconnected, cohesive automation system. This project will provide ongoing beginner-level experiences in IoT product development, self-hosted services, and interconnectivity Protocols.

This project serves as the parent project, encompassing many individual projects that combine to achieve the larger goal of transforming the IEEE Lab into a Modern Smart Lab. We'll accomplish this through automation and intelligent IoT devices, keeping everything locally hosted on our servers. This approach eliminates the need for external cloud services and utilizes open-source alternatives where necessary.

We'll achieve this vision through a series of small, individual projects. These will be integrated one by one into an interconnected system of devices, all controllable through a single, locally hosted system (on Home Assistant).
