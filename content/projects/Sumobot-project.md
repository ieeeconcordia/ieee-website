## About

The members of this project aim to compete in IEEE Concordia's RoboWars 2025 by building and programming their own autonomous sumobot. This robot should independently navigate, detect, and outmaneuver opponents in the sumobot arena. Therefore, the team will focus on a strategic design to advance past each round of the competition. Come to RoboWars on May 17th and see us showcase the final creation!!
