## About The Project

The objective of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a custom remote-controlled (RC) drone that showcases advanced features such as autonomous flight, real-time FPV (First Person View) video transmission, obstacle avoidance, and robust navigation capabilities. This project will involve a multidisciplinary team working collaboratively to integrate skills and technologies in aerodynamics, electronics, design, and software development.
