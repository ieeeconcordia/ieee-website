## About

The objective of this project is to use VHDL and an in-house FPGA to create a multicore, single-cycle RISC-V CPU.

* Phase 1: Introduces foundational FPGA and VHDL skills, such as setting up the basic environment for programming the FPGA, basic syntax, writing combinational and sequential logic, how to simulate and implement the design onto the board, and finding a synthesizer, wave simulator, and compiler.
* Phase 2: Focuses on designing a 32-bit RISC-V CPU, including the ALU, register file, PC, instruction memory, immediate extend, control unit, and datapath components.
* Phase 3: Develops the multicore CPU by integrating the common bus, cache, core communication, and connecting all cores to common memory.

By the end of this project, every member will have finished their core, learned the architecture of a single cycle CPI, and knows how to operate an FPGA!
