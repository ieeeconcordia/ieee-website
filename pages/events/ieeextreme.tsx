            IEEEXtreme is a global 24-hour marathon during which teams of three
            or four programmers are given a set of programming questions to
            solve. As soon as the countdown begins, team members will need to
            cooperate, strategize, and join their coding skills together to
            solve a set of challenging programming problems.
          </p>
