## About The Event

Are you ready to bring your design ideas to life? Join us for an exciting workshop where you'll dive into the world of Fusion 360, a cutting-edge 3D CAD modeling software used by designers, engineers, and artists worldwide. This workshop is catered to students with no prior experience in 3D modeling nor 3D printing. It covers the fundamental functionalities of the software and design approaches when creating a 3D model. Students will be guided through the design of a common object and will be able to take it home at the end of the workshop!

## What You Need

We will be using Fusion 360. To follow along with the presentation, you must have a computer with Fusion installed on it. There is a free educational license for students. Please come to the workshop with a working copy of the software. If you need help with the installation process, reach out in advance and we will be glad to help.
